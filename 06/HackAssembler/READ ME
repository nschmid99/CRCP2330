To use this assembler, go to the HackAssembler.pde tab. This is the main tab where all other classes are called. At the top there is a String called fileName where you can type  in the name of the file that you would like to parse. It currently says String fileName="Rect"; for easy identification. From there hit the run button to run the assembler. How this assembler works is that the Code class is where all C-Instruction translations are located  and the SymbolTable class is where all pre-defined symbols are located as well as where to add new symbols to the table and where ROM and RAM are tracked. The parser class basically just breaks the .asm file into smaller chunks so that it can be easily and properly  translated. It  gets rid of excess and sorts the code by type (A,C,L); Then in the HackAssembler class everything is combined to be able to translate the .asm file and save it to a .hack file
